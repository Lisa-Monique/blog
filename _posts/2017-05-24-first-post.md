<p>Hey everyone! Thanks for taking the time to visit - I really, really appreciate it. This post is just going to be a little intro to this blog and why I'm starting this.</p>
<p>So i'm currently lying in my bright pink, 29º, St. Lucian bedroom after about 8 months away. I've been back home for about 5 days now and I'm still not sure if its set in that I'm back. I'm not even entirely sure its set in that I left in the first place. This past year has been filled with unbelievable blessings and even more unthinkable struggles but here I am on the other side - still going strong.</p> 
<p>I think the most surreal part of it all is that I'm even here writing the words you’re reading right now. I've contemplated doing this for longer than I'd like to admit but due to past experiences, I procrastinate a lot when it comes to putting myself out there. But with recent events (including multiple deaths that hit too close to home) I think its safe to say there's really no time like the present.</p>
<p>So welcome! Thanks so much for being here and helping me along this journey we're about to make together. My hope for this blog is that it will be a place I can document my life in Canada, university, science, my research and possibly vent from time to time. I am a young, black, female, West-Indian, Computer Scientist and I hope that if you're ever feeling a bit unmotivated, discouraged or broken by life, my successes can uplift you and my struggles can let you know you're not alone.</p>
<p>It's now or never right?</p>
