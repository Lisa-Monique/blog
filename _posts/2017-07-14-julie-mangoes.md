Hey everyone! So its been a while and we're off to a rocky start but I thought I'd bring some life back to this blog by sharing a painting I did a few months ago. As someone who grew up in the Caribbean, experiencing my first Canadian winter left me a bit homesick. This acrylic piece expressed some of the things I missed most about home: the colours, the mangoes and the carefree lifestyle where climbing trees to steal some fruit is acceptable! Hope you like it!
