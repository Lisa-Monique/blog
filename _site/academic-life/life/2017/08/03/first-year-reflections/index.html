                    <p><p>I remember back in April when I sat back, took my first deep breath in months and it finally really sank in that I had completed my first year of university. And honestly, all I could think was "THANK GOD ITS OVER"! I mean don't get me wrong, this year has been absolutely amazing but also unbelievably trying. So although I may not remember the specific date or time, I don't think I'll ever forget that overwhelming  mixture of pride and relief; one which I'm sure only comes second to graduation. Now, three months later, I just felt like I should take this last bit of summer to reflect on the past year to remind myself of how I've gotten to where I am today.  So here we go:
</p>
<p><img src="/img/IMGP9058.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="848" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58" /></p>

<p>Ok so I lied. To start, I actually have to go back not one, not two, not even three but four years! All the way back to  2013. I had just started community college and my best friend, and I had a fire burning inside. We were heart-set on attending the illustrious Cambridge University and we were prepared to put every ounce of blood, sweat and tears in us into making that happen. We pushed each other a lot and kept the dream alive and honestly, had the circumstances been more in our favour, we probably would have had decent odds. But by the end of that first year, the hope of that had pretty much faded.</p>
<p><img src="/img/IMG_2592 2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61" /></p>

<p>We both still had our hearts set on university in the UK though. So after many hurdles (and just as I had given up hope of going) in July 2014  we flew to the UK to visit the University of Surrey, the University of Sheffield and the University of Birmingham. The highlight for me though, was finally getting to see what it was really like to live in this country I had fantasized about for so long. And I must say: it captured my heart. I learned a lot about myself, my independence and what's important to me and finally after visiting Birmingham I had found my home away from home (I thought).</p>
<p><img src="/img/IMG_5091 2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5500.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5198 2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73" /></p>

<p>Fast forward a few months and we started our applications: Cheyenne -Astrophysics and for me - Genetics. But half-way through my applications, I looked up the day to day life of a geneticist and I got this gut wrenching, terrifying feeling that it wasn’t for me. I tried looking into other majors like zoology, pharmacology, biomedical laboratory technology and then landed on marine biology. I tried scuba diving and even looked into programs in Australia. But those programs began in January and application deadlines for the UK programs were nearing. So as you can imagine, I was really lost and conflicted so I finally made the decision to take a gap year.</p>

<p>I spent most of my time volunteering at a clinical laboratory but my focus was always exploring my options. I would often see the word "Bioinformatics"  but completely ignore it because I had never heard of it. Then one day I stopped and realised it was everything I was interested in BUT wrapped up with computer science. Now here in Saint Lucia, Computer Science wasn't exactly something you had access to in classes. The only thing remotely related was Information Technology which I hated and therefore didn’t take. So now I found myself curious and with a bunch of free time. Sooo... I did the only logical thing to do when you take a year off from school: online courses! (Yay!)  And guys, I had found the program of my nerdy dreams!</p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_0810.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77" /></p>

<p>This revelation shifted my entire focus to Canada. I applied to the University of Toronto, the University of British Columbia and the University of Western Ontario and got accepted to them all. Only thing was: how was my single mother supposed to afford UofT's $41,000 tuition or UBC's $38,000 or even Western's $26,000? I mean that’s up to $500,000 XCD for a four year degree!</p>

<p>Now I was a great student (and please don't take that as bragging) but even then my scholarship options were limited and unlikely. So imagine my surprise when I received notification of an Outstanding  International Student Award from the University of British Columbia. Still not enough to afford attending but nonetheless amazing. The real shock however, came when I received an international call from a woman who very calmly informed me that following from my application, essay and interview I had been awarded one of only THREE International President's Entrance Scholarships from the University of Western Ontario. I literally had to pull over because my hands were shaking too much to drive. I even cried y'all. </p>
<p>And that's where this story really begins but this post is already too long so let's leave the rest for Part II! See you then!</p>
