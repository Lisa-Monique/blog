            <p>Welcome to <strong>Life as Lisa-Monique!</strong><br />
            I'm Lisa-Monique and this is my blog. I'm a born and raised St. Lucian currently working towards my undergrad degree in Canada in Bioinformatics (don't worry, nobody knows what that is).</p>
            <p>That means I'm a young, black, female, West-Indian in a white man's world. And honestly, I'm subliminally reminded of it everyday but that's a topic for another day.</p>
            <p>I also paint, draw, dance and basically anything else artistic/creative you can think of. Except writing that is, I absolutely hate writing. And I mean writing of all kinds: poems, short stories, essays everything.</p>
            <p>Then why start a blog you might be wondering? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. I've wanted to do this for a long time and I finally decided that life is too short to not follow your passions and see where they lead. Hopefully I can use this platform to celebrate the good times, reflect on the bad and share with the world.</p>
